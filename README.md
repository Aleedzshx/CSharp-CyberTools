**CyberTools**

**TryHackMe** 

A platform where you learn through hands-on practice in safe environments, both offensive and defensive. I really enjoyed the experience: I learned about Red Teams, Blue Teams, and Purple Teams, and the strategic approach to attacks particularly struck me.

It was a lot of fun and I gained valuable concepts, but now I want to focus on solidifying the fundamentals so I can start university with a strong base. I’ll continue studying some topics later — especially advanced offensive and defensive strategy.

Next steps: Strengthen my Python skills, terminal/Linux commands, and networking fundamentals to maximize the benefits of TryHackMe challenges.

**SENA: Mitigation and Prevention of Cybersecurity Threats**  

I haven't found these classes very engaging; I expected more practical sessions, but so far, they have been mostly theoretical. I have already submitted and completed two activities from the first module, which included creating an infographic and a questionnaire. So far, nothing surprising—just some basic content.
